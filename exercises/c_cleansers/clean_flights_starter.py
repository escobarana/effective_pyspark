# Exercise:
# “clean” a CSV file using PySpark.
# * Grab sample data from https://packages.revolutionanalytics.com/datasets/AirlineSubsetCsv.tar.gz
#   A copy of the data can be found on our S3 bucket (link shared in class).
# * Inspect the columns: what type of data do they hold?
# * Create an ETL job with PySpark where you read in the csv file, and perform
#   the cleansing steps mentioned in the classroom:
#   - improve column names (subjective)
#   - fix data types
#   - flag missing or unknown data
#   - remove redundant data
# * Write the data to a parquet file. How big is the parquet file compared
#   to the compressed csv file? And compared to the uncompressed csv file?
#   How long does your processing take?
# * While your job is running, open up the Spark UI and get a feel for what's
#   there (together with the instructor).
# For explanations on the columns, check https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp?gnoyr_VQ=FGK
